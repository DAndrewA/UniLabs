# SS08: Superconductivity

This lab saw Alex and I analysing pre-collected data for superconducting Tin and Lead as functions of temperature and applied magnetic field.

The code written can be found in the subdirectories of SS08/RemoteData/SS08DataforRemote. It mostly consists of plotting the collected data, and then the hard-coded values that we determined from the original sets of curves. It was written to be functional on the day, so isn't particularly well commented, but it all worked as intended and got the job done.
