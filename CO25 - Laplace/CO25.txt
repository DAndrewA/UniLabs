Mon Dec  9 11:58:18 2019: took the given function header and copied it into MATLAB, changing author and date
Mon Dec  9 12:10:31 2019: Using equation 5 from lab script, wrote basic calculation that needed computing
Mon Dec  9 12:17:02 2019: Wrote a seperate function, R(p,x,y) to calculate the residual values
Mon Dec  9 12:28:36 2019: Created a while loop in which the itterations will occur. Also added the functionality for the computations to end after the itteration limit has been reached.
Mon Dec  9 12:30:18 2019: Wrote the for loops that will allow the computation to occur throughout the grid. This hould allow for the program to now be tested.
Mon Dec  9 13:07:51 2019: Added the code to keep track of the historical recorded values on the grid
Mon Dec  9 13:50:21 2019: tested the code on a grid with the boundary conditions of 1s along two adjacent sides and 0s on the other. Using a countour plot, the surface formed seemed reasonable, and the psi matrix had the required transpose symettry that this solution required.
Mon Dec  9 13:50:48 2019: However, there was a problem that all the recorded historical values just gave 0
Mon Dec  9 13:59:31 2019: This problem occured because when trying to pick out specific values of psi, parsing a vector into the index argument would be treated as two seperate serial integers (i.e, the 4th and 2nd element of psi would be picked, instead of that at (4,2))
Mon Dec  9 14:02:24 2019: the solution was to call each element of the vector seperately (messy, but works) and convergence of the values of a 7x7 grid was shown to occur over ~13 itterations
Mon Dec  9 14:09:32 2019: [CREATED PLOT OF CONVERGENCE OF HISTORICAL VALUES AND CONTOUR PLOT OF PSI FOR REPORT, UNDER firstPlot name]
Wed Dec 11 16:02:36 2019: Determined solution from lab script to be sin(x/a)sinh(y/a), and will now attempt to test this
Wed Dec 11 16:08:09 2019: Before running the sunction, I checked to make sure analyticPsi and initPsi had same boundary conditions
Wed Dec 11 16:29:08 2019: Ran the laplace_solver, compared and plotted two solutions, and differences between them
Wed Dec 11 16:30:15 2019: determined average difference between calculated and analytic solution as mean(mean(psi - analyticPsi)) = -0.0070
Wed Dec 11 16:35:36 2019: Also recorded and plotted historical values
Wed Dec 11 16:36:23 2019: For these caluclations, \alpha = 1.35, itterations=100
Wed Dec 11 16:48:38 2019: Added in functionality to terminate after fewer itterations than planned
Wed Dec 11 18:35:05 2019: wrote function to help with analysis of different alpha values n things
