# CO25: Laplace's equation

This practical focussed on writing code to numerically solve Laplace's equation via the method of over-relaxation. There is also code to solve for internal boundary conditions (Poisson's equation), but due to time constraints this wasn't used in my lab report.

Examples of how the code is used can be found in examples.m. They include mathematical functions, as well as the caluclation of streamlines around a cylinder, as suggested in the practical's extension.
