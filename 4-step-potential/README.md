# 4-step-potential

I wrote this code to demonstrate my solution to a problem I was asked to present in a tutorial. The problem is given in the pdf document (question 5) and I decided to test if the principle upon which I'd answered it held in more complicated scenarios.

Examplpes for using the code can be found in examples.m. They include a solution to the problem posed in the tutorial, as well as more complicated step potentials.
