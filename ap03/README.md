# AP03

This project involved using data from the IR channels of the SEVIRI instrument onboard the METEOSAT satellites to infer information like the Earth's surface temperature, cloud heights, and afternoon cooling rates.

The code I wrote, found in the "data" and "My code" repositories is mostly focussed on extracting and plotting data. This was my first use of numpy and matplotlib, so some of the code is rough around the edges.
