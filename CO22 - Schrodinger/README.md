# CO22: Numerically solving Schrodinger's equation

This practical was concerned with solving Schrodinger's equation numerically using Numerov's method, limitting it to the case where the differential equation has no (d^1 / dt^1){x} term.

Examples for how the code is used can be found at the start of each file.
